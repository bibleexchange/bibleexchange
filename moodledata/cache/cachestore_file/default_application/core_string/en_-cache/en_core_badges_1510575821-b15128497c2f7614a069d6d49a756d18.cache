It may be that your firewall prevents access from users outside your network, your site is password protected, or you are running the site on a computer that is not available from the Internet (such as a local development machine).

**Is this a problem?**

You should fix this issue on any production site where you are planning to issue badges, otherwise the recipients will not be able to prove they earned their badges from you. If your site is not yet live you can create and issue test badges, as long as the site is accessible before you go live.

* **AVAILABLE** – Means that this badge can be earned by users. While a badge is available to users, its criteria cannot be modified.

* **NOT AVAILABLE** – Means that this badge is not available to users and cannot be earned or manually issued. If such badge has never been issued before, its criteria can be changed.

Once a badge has been issued to at least one user, it automatically becomes **LOCKED**. Locked badges can still be earned by users, but their criteria can no longer be changed. If you need to modify details or criteria of a locked badge, you can duplicate this badge and make all the required changes.

*Why do we lock badges?*

We want to make sure that all users complete the same requirements to earn a badge. Currently, it is not possible to revoke badges. If we allowed badges requirements to be modified all the time, we would most likely end up with users having the same badge for meeting completely different requirements.";s:7:"subject";s:15:"Message subject";s:20:"variablesubstitution";s:34:"Variable substitution in messages.";s:25:"variablesubstitution_help";s:510:"In a badge message, certain variables can be inserted into the subject and/or body of a message so that they will be replaced with real values when the message is sent.
