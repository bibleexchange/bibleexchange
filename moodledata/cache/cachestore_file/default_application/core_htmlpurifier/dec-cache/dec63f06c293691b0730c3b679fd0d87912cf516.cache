s:1350:"<p>External tools allow Moodle users to seamlessly interact with learning resources hosted remotely. Through a special
launch protocol, the remote tool will have access to some general information about the launching user. For example,
the institution name, course id, user id, and other information such as the user's name or e-mail address.</p>

<p>Tools listed on this page are separated into three categories:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Active</strong> - These tool providers have been approved and configured by an administrator. They can be used from within any
    course on this Moodle instance. If a consumer key and shared secret are entered, a trust relationship is established
    between this Moodle instance and the remote tool, providing a secure communication channel.</li>
<li><strong>Pending</strong> - These tool providers came in through a package import, but have not been configured by an administrator.
    Teachers may still use tools from these providers if they have a consumer key and shared secret, or if none is required.</li>
<li><strong>Rejected</strong> - These tools providers are flagged as ones which an administrator has no intention of making available to the entire
    Moodle instance. Teachers may still use tools from these providers if they have a consumer key and shared secret, or if none is required.</li>
</ul>";
